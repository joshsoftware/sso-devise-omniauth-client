== SSO with Devise and Omniauth Client

This is the client that uses ONLY omniauth to connect to a custom provider
for single sign on between multiple applications.

== Usage

    git clone git://github.com/joshsoftware/sso-devise-omniauth-client.git
    bundle install
    rake db:create
    rake db:migrate

== Configure the Client

On the *Provider*, register this client application:
    rails c
    > @client = Client.new
    > @client.app_id = 'some key'
    > @client.app_secret = 'some secret'
    > @client.save

Copy these same values in the *Client* config/initializers/omniauth.rb

    APP_ID = 'some key' 
    APP_SECRET = 'some secret'
    
    # Update your custom Omniauth provider URL here
    CUSTOM_PROVIDER_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'
        
    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :josh_id, APP_ID, APP_SECRET
    end 

== The custom Omniauth strategy

Since we want a single sign-on between our server and our client apps, we need to write 
a custom omniauth strategy. This is written in lib/josh_id.rb. Please implement your own
and / or modify as required.

== To test single sign-on

    git clone git://github.com/joshsoftware/sso-devise-omniauth-client.git client1
    git clone git://github.com/joshsoftware/sso-devise-omniauth-client.git client2


    # configure the client1 key and secret in the provider as mentioned above

    # In separater terminals start 2 clients
    client1 $ rails s -p3001 
    client2 $ rails s -p3002

Now, if you login via 1 client, and change the URL to the other, you will be automatically
signed-in!

I am eager to write some rspec for this setup. If you do, please send me a pull request!
